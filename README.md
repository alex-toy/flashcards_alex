Hi viewer! I'm Alex and this is my third Udacity project "Flashcards" based on react native. 

It involved skills using :
- navigation features like TabNavigator, StackNavigator
- LocalStorage,
- stylesheets,
- local Notifications

To launch it you need to install react on your computer and then :

1) cd into the directory containing the files

2) npm install

3) npm start


Once the app is working, please enter a pseudo and password, then enjoy !! ;-)
